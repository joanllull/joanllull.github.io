    <meta name="Description" content="Joan Llull is Research Professor at CSIC and Associate Research Professor of the Barcelona School of Economics. He is also an External Fellow at CReAM (UCL). He graduated from CEMFI in 2011. Prior to joining CSIC, he worked at Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona and MOVE. His research focuses on labor economics, and more specifically on immigration, internal migration, occupational mobility, inequality, human capital, family economics, and health. His main research typically estimates dynamic discrete choice models of equilibrium, but several of his papers also use more reduced form approaches. His work has been published in the Review of Economic Studies, Journal of Human Resources, and the European Economic Review, among others. His research has been funded by prestigious grants, including a Starting Grant from the European Research Council (ERC). He is the Data Editor of the Econometric Society (for its journals Econometrica, Quantitative Economics, and Theoretical Economics) and editorial board member of the Review of Economic Studies. He has also served as Data Editor at the Economic Journal and the Econometrics Journal, associate editor of SERIEs --- The Journal of the Spanish Economic Association, and guest editor for Labour Economics, the Journal of the European Association of Labour Economists. Professor Llull teaches graduate courses at UAB and at the BSE, and several courses at the BSE Summer School." >

                <p>
                    Welcome to my website. I am a Research Professor at the Institute of Economic Analysis of the Centro de Estudios de Investigaciones Cient&iacute;ficas (IAE-CSIC), and Associate Research Professor at the Barcelona School of Economics. I am also an External Fellow at CReAM (UCL). I graduated from CEMFI in 2011.
				</p>
				
				<p>
                    I am the <a href="https://www.econometricsociety.org/publications/es-data-editor-website">Data Editor of the Econometric Society</a> for its journals <i>Econometrica</i>, <i>Quantitative Economics</i>, and <i>Theoretical Economics</i> (check the corresponding Data Editor websites here and <a href="https://ectjdataeditor.github.io/">here</a>), and Editorial Board Member of the <i>Review of Economic Studies</i>. I have also served as an Associate Editor of <i>SERIEs&mdash;The Journal of the Spanish Economic Association</i> and a Guest Editor of <i>Labour Economics</i>, the Journal of the European Association of Labour Economists.

                <p>
                    My research interests are in Labor Economics and Structural Microeconometrics. My current research focuses on immigration, internal migration, occupational mobility, inequality, human capital accumulation, technological progress, and labor market frictions. I initiated and have continuously (co-)organized the <a href="https://www.bse.eu/summer-forum/workshop-structural-microeconometrics">Structural Microeconometrics</a> and <a href="https://www.bse.eu/summer-forum/workshop-migration">Migration</a> sessions at the Summer Forum of the BSE. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    In 2018 I was awarded a European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant for my project &quot;Dynamic Modeling of Labor Market Mobility and Human Capital Accumulation (DYMOLAMO)&quot;. This project, which runs until January 2025, allowed me to provide a deeper understanding of the interrelations between labor mobility (mostly geographical, but also occupational) and human capital accumulation. The projects focuses on internal and international migration, providing empirical analyes using data for the United States and Spain. 
                </p>
                
                <!--p>
				    In 2023 I was awarded a European Research Council (ERC) Consolidator Grant for my project &quot;Optimal Immigration Policy (OPIMPOL)&quot;. This project, which is expected to run for a period of five years starting on February of 2025, will provide a unified framework to quantify the optimal immigration policies. These policies, broadly defined, are aimed to maximize the surplus from immigration, compensate potential losers from it, internalize the consequences of policies for developing countries, and foster integration of immigrants in the labor market. While the empirical analyses are conducted using data for the United States, the framework and the conclusions are expected to be usable in other contexts.

I have taught different graduate courses on a broad set of topics in Microeconometrics (see my teaching <a href="teaching.htm">here</a>). I also teach courses on <a href="https://bse.eu/study/summer-school/labor-economics">Migration</a> and <a href="https://bse.eu/study/summer-school/microeconometrics">Structural Microeconometrics</a> at the Labor Economics and Microeconometrics BSE Summer Schools.
